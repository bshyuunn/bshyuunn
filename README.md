## Who am i
Hello, my name is Songhyun Bae. üñêÔ∏è

For the past few years, I have specialized in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, actively conducting research and participating in bug bounty programs through fuzzing and vulnerability discovery. Recently, I have been focusing on Web3 Security, competing in Web3 auditing competitions and researching smart contract vulnerabilities.

I also love exploring and building security tools, especially for fuzzing, exploit development, automation, and AI-driven security analysis.
